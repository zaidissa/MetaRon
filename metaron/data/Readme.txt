The data folder contains sample inputs as well as operon predictions for ERR022075 Escherichia coli paired end reads. 

The pipeline can predict operons from raw reads as well as assembled scaffolds and prodigal predicted genes,

Paired-end Illumina reads for E. coli MG1655 can be downloaded from:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERR022075

Assembled scaffolds via IDBA (ERR022075_scaffold.fa) and gene predictions (ERR022075) via Prodigal are already included in the data folder.
